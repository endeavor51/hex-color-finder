# Hex Color Finder (HCF)

Hex Color Finder (aka HCF) was released by NZ Software in 2002 to help users easily identify and work with colors. HCF helps users identify RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) and hexadecimal (HEX) values for an on-screen color, as well as manipulate colors and identify codes.  It also lets users save and load their color sets.
